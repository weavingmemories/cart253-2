/* The sky class will be a class that is generated to look 'soft' with either noise or changePixels
   function, and will be dynamic and change color based on what color it is seeing from the webcam
   from the video library. It will likely keep the same color for a certain amount of time to keep
   the calming vibe and not be chaotic.
